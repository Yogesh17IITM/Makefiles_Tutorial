Work Environment details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OS	:	Linux (UBUNTU)
Compiler:	GCC
Other	:	GMake (inbuilt in linux platforms)

To see how it works, simply type "make" in the CURRENT DIRECTORY.

The make command will look for the Makefile/makefile by default and execute the bash commands in the makefile (Sequentially).

Note:
In this case, the command will direct to switch from CURRENT DIR. to WORKING DIR. during the process.
Once the program is completed, the results are then copied to CURRENT DIRECTORY
