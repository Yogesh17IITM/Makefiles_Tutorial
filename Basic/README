Work Environment details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OS	:	Linux (UBUNTU)
Compiler:	GCC
Other	:	GMake (inbuilt in linux platforms)

To see how it works, simply type "make" in the CURRENT DIRECTORY.

The make command will look for the Makefile/makefile by default and execute the bash commands in the makefile (Sequentially).
